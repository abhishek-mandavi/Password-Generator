# Password Generator:-
Approach-
The application employs the 'passwordgenerator' function to generate random passwords. 
This function operates by iterating through chosen character sets, tailoring the password to user preferences. 
To facilitate easy password copying, the application incorporates the 'copyToClipboard' functionality. 
This feature leverages a temporary text area element, ensuring seamless copying, and provides users with a success message upon successful completion.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
